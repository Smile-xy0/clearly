# Clearly

Clearly is a guided meditation manager. It lets you find guided meditations from
around the internet, add them to your personal collection, and track the ones
you've used before.

I built this app because I often do guided meditations, but sometimes I would
play a guided meditation from online only to realize that I had listened to it
before. I hope you find it as useful as I do.
